This proposal requests 200k USDC as compensation for the [Exploit Disclosure - DXdao Governance](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625).

Overview: The exploit made use of a mismatch between the smart contract functionality and the front end implementations. By setting a `periods` variable when building a proposal manually, a user was able to set a multiplier on their proposal up to `2**256 - 1` (unit256). Allowing a proposal as innocuous as a rep boost to mint 99% of REP in the DAO, effectively turning the DAO into an EOA - as in being able to pass proposals / do transfers instantly.

Interesting fact, an unsigned integer with 256 bits (unit256), means a maximum value (i.e. multiplier) of 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 could have been set - where even 1 wei of REP minted would have made up over 99% of REP.

During June 2022, after the disclosure above, DXvote reflected periods in the UI. Thereby, making it easier to monitor and reduce risk of such a malicious proposal passing. Furthermore, there are ongoing efforts to add a validation check to the Contributor Scheme so it only accepts new proposals with a single period.

After discussion in the forum, on the weekly dev and governance call, as well as individual conversations with contributors and DXD holders, $200k appears to be an amount with support across the board. A [forum signal vote](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625/16) had 60+% votes over $200k and a [DXD snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hack24.eth/proposal/0x3fe5da3a2e700c13bad5482de17f6c17c59c54f24b023bf09f7811d5953499b3) 80+% in the $100k-$200k range.

Note that DLABS was in no way involved in the coding or auditing of the Contribution Scheme contract. In fact, both of these precede the incorporation of DLABS itself. 

This proposal pays $200k USDC to Decentral Labs LLC (DLABS) at dlabs.eth

QmV4uU6frapxa7Q5rHn4pYpJuLPhdn7CJgtQb2DcT2sihM,Approve New DXD Token Model,"
_Tldr: The DXD Token Working Group proposes a new token model, where “DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.”_

## Background

The DXD Bonding Curve was [launched in May of 2020](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xeb9cf2b3d76664dc1e983137f33b2400ad11966b1d79399d7ca55c25ad6283fa) by DXdao. The bonding curve was an effective fundraising tool but the mint/burn functions of the contract were never able to create a liquid market for DXD. In May 2021, DXdao [launched the DXD Buyback program](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) which purchased DXD off the open market using ETH from the general treasury as well as from the buyback reserve. The program [bought over 15,000 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit#gid=1629643942) (30% of circulating supply), but it was never viewed as a sustainable long-term model for DXD value accrual.

Since the bonding curve launched, DXdao has built and managed several DeFi and governance products, diversified its treasury into $10m+ of stablecoins, and has a team of 20+ full-time contributors focused on building and growing the DXdao ecosystem. The DXD token is at the center of this ecosystem, but there has not been a formal link between the value that DXdao creates and the DXD token. This creates uncertainty for DXD holders, especially as DXD has traded at a significant discount to book value.

In August 2022, DXdao [launched the DXD Token Working Group](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) to draft a long-term model for DXD. The below signal proposal is an output from the Working Group.

The proposal commits DXdao to:



* Introduce four tools in the DXD Monetary Policy Framework that would enable a fair and liquid market for DXD
* Establish a DXD Monetary Policy Committee
* Funding product development and other initiatives that further DXdao’s core mission to enable community freedom 

To further simplify and answer the question, “Why is DXD valuable?”, the WG affirms: **DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.**

## Details

**DXD Monetary Policy Framework**
This proposal establishes four tools to be used by DXdao governance under guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. These are:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee - DXdao commits to buying any amount of DXD on the open market 
* Inverse bonds - smart contracts where DXD can be deposited for a defined period of time in return for a certain % of DXdao treasury assets 
* New DXD minted - allow DXD to be minted in exchange for assets at full NAV
* Protocol-owned liquidity for DXD

**DXD Monetary Policy Committee**
Management of these tools requires close tracking of the DXD market as well as DXdao’s treasury. The committee should be at least three individuals and also include full-time contributors. This work should be compensated in vested DXD. The committee is tasked with:



* Providing quarterly reports on general general direction and outlook of DXD
* Issue monthly recommendations on inverse bond issuance and protocol-owned liquidity
* Work with DXdao governance and treasury on managing redemptions

**Product development funding**
DXdao’s mission is to enable community freedom. It was launched in 2019 as a radical experiment in decentralization. The DXD fundraiser was intended to raise funds for product development in line with this vision. The new token model represents a new social contract between REP & DXD holders. The DXD Token WG affirms DXdao’s commitment to building and funding decentralized products that enable community freedom by committing at least 6% of DXdao’s treasury to fund DXdao’s product & operations for a year.

This % can be changed at any time by governance and represents an overall budget suggestion for DXdao and is not a mandate to spend that amount, nor a maximum amount . This incentivizes the community to grow the size of the treasury.

## Implementation

This signal proposal is the output of the DXD Token Working Group, and if passed by REP & DXD holders, should be implemented by DXdao. Some of the elements will require significant development work before they can be put into practice. In the DXD Monetary Policy Framework, the DXD Floor Price Guarantee and the protocol-owned liquidity can be implemented using DXdao’s existing governance tools. 

This proposal commits to implement:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee priced at 70% of the current DXD-NAV Ratio (DXD's circulating market cap to Treasury NAV)
* Provide $250k in DXD/ETH on mainnet once DXD price hits 60% of Treasury NAV, another $250k deposit at 65%, and a $500k deposit when it hits 70% of NAV
* When ready, DXdao governance commits to issuing:
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 85% payout after 6 months will be issued, along with 
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 90% of NAV payout after one year, and
     - $1m in DXD Inverse bonds with 100% NAV payout after two years
* The current DXD token contract should be upgraded and the funds returned to the general treasury

## Definition and clarifications



* Treasury NAV - ultimately defined by governance through guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. This proposal affirms treasury NAV includes all stablecoins, ETH (including staked ETH and other derivatives), Swapr LPs or other liquidity provisioning instruments. It incorporates the value of other treasury assets (like SWPR, ENS, etc) with a pre-defined liquidity discount. The DXD-NAV ratio is the DXD circulating market cap (as defined in the last DXD buyback proposal) divided by the Treasury NAV. This will be calculated at least bi-weekly. The [latest version can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mS1sVmyP0Z3YiA1JiZpHgPHjSIh3da7MawpjQodE34Y/edit#gid=0).
* Inverse bonds - these will be individually launched according to specific parameters (duration, dividend stream, etc). The bonds should payout the % of NAV when they are due, not the NAV when the bond is issued or the DXD deposited. Bonds will need to have a redemption currency of either ETH or Dai/USDC.
* DXD Monetary Policy Committee is meant to involve engaged DXD holders in the formation of policy, but report preparation will need to be completed by DXdao contributors. Details of this will be further provided in the upcoming budget presentations by DXdao governance.
* DXdao may implement other tools to the DXD Monetary Policy Framework in addition to the four listed above. The goal is to incentivize an organic fair market for DXD with minimal open market operations and minimal changes to the underlying liquidity for the treasury.
* Execution of the price floor guarantee will occur on-chain through various trustless models. Previous DXD purchases were in smaller amounts, so executing on a larger scale will require more coordination.

This proposal requests 200k USDC as compensation for the [Exploit Disclosure - DXdao Governance](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625).

Overview: The exploit made use of a mismatch between the smart contract functionality and the front end implementations. By setting a `periods` variable when building a proposal manually, a user was able to set a multiplier on their proposal up to `2**256 - 1` (unit256). Allowing a proposal as innocuous as a rep boost to mint 99% of REP in the DAO, effectively turning the DAO into an EOA - as in being able to pass proposals / do transfers instantly.

Interesting fact, an unsigned integer with 256 bits (unit256), means a maximum value (i.e. multiplier) of 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 could have been set - where even 1 wei of REP minted would have made up over 99% of REP.

During June 2022, after the disclosure above, DXvote reflected periods in the UI. Thereby, making it easier to monitor and reduce risk of such a malicious proposal passing. Furthermore, there are ongoing efforts to add a validation check to the Contributor Scheme so it only accepts new proposals with a single period.

After discussion in the forum, on the weekly dev and governance call, as well as individual conversations with contributors and DXD holders, $200k appears to be an amount with support across the board. A [forum signal vote](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625/16) had 60+% votes over $200k and a [DXD snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hack24.eth/proposal/0x3fe5da3a2e700c13bad5482de17f6c17c59c54f24b023bf09f7811d5953499b3) 80+% in the $100k-$200k range.

Note that DLABS was in no way involved in the coding or auditing of the Contribution Scheme contract. In fact, both of these precede the incorporation of DLABS itself. 

This proposal pays $200k USDC to Decentral Labs LLC (DLABS) at dlabs.eth

QmV4uU6frapxa7Q5rHn4pYpJuLPhdn7CJgtQb2DcT2sihM,Approve New DXD Token Model,"
_Tldr: The DXD Token Working Group proposes a new token model, where “DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.”_

## Background

The DXD Bonding Curve was [launched in May of 2020](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xeb9cf2b3d76664dc1e983137f33b2400ad11966b1d79399d7ca55c25ad6283fa) by DXdao. The bonding curve was an effective fundraising tool but the mint/burn functions of the contract were never able to create a liquid market for DXD. In May 2021, DXdao [launched the DXD Buyback program](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) which purchased DXD off the open market using ETH from the general treasury as well as from the buyback reserve. The program [bought over 15,000 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit#gid=1629643942) (30% of circulating supply), but it was never viewed as a sustainable long-term model for DXD value accrual.

Since the bonding curve launched, DXdao has built and managed several DeFi and governance products, diversified its treasury into $10m+ of stablecoins, and has a team of 20+ full-time contributors focused on building and growing the DXdao ecosystem. The DXD token is at the center of this ecosystem, but there has not been a formal link between the value that DXdao creates and the DXD token. This creates uncertainty for DXD holders, especially as DXD has traded at a significant discount to book value.

In August 2022, DXdao [launched the DXD Token Working Group](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) to draft a long-term model for DXD. The below signal proposal is an output from the Working Group.

The proposal commits DXdao to:



* Introduce four tools in the DXD Monetary Policy Framework that would enable a fair and liquid market for DXD
* Establish a DXD Monetary Policy Committee
* Funding product development and other initiatives that further DXdao’s core mission to enable community freedom 

To further simplify and answer the question, “Why is DXD valuable?”, the WG affirms: **DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.**

## Details

**DXD Monetary Policy Framework**
This proposal establishes four tools to be used by DXdao governance under guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. These are:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee - DXdao commits to buying any amount of DXD on the open market 
* Inverse bonds - smart contracts where DXD can be deposited for a defined period of time in return for a certain % of DXdao treasury assets 
* New DXD minted - allow DXD to be minted in exchange for assets at full NAV
* Protocol-owned liquidity for DXD

**DXD Monetary Policy Committee**
Management of these tools requires close tracking of the DXD market as well as DXdao’s treasury. The committee should be at least three individuals and also include full-time contributors. This work should be compensated in vested DXD. The committee is tasked with:



* Providing quarterly reports on general general direction and outlook of DXD
* Issue monthly recommendations on inverse bond issuance and protocol-owned liquidity
* Work with DXdao governance and treasury on managing redemptions

**Product development funding**
DXdao’s mission is to enable community freedom. It was launched in 2019 as a radical experiment in decentralization. The DXD fundraiser was intended to raise funds for product development in line with this vision. The new token model represents a new social contract between REP & DXD holders. The DXD Token WG affirms DXdao’s commitment to building and funding decentralized products that enable community freedom by committing at least 6% of DXdao’s treasury to fund DXdao’s product & operations for a year.

This % can be changed at any time by governance and represents an overall budget suggestion for DXdao and is not a mandate to spend that amount, nor a maximum amount . This incentivizes the community to grow the size of the treasury.

## Implementation

This signal proposal is the output of the DXD Token Working Group, and if passed by REP & DXD holders, should be implemented by DXdao. Some of the elements will require significant development work before they can be put into practice. In the DXD Monetary Policy Framework, the DXD Floor Price Guarantee and the protocol-owned liquidity can be implemented using DXdao’s existing governance tools. 

This proposal commits to implement:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee priced at 70% of the current DXD-NAV Ratio (DXD's circulating market cap to Treasury NAV)
* Provide $250k in DXD/ETH on mainnet once DXD price hits 60% of Treasury NAV, another $250k deposit at 65%, and a $500k deposit when it hits 70% of NAV
* When ready, DXdao governance commits to issuing:
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 85% payout after 6 months will be issued, along with 
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 90% of NAV payout after one year, and
     - $1m in DXD Inverse bonds with 100% NAV payout after two years
* The current DXD token contract should be upgraded and the funds returned to the general treasury

## Definition and clarifications



* Treasury NAV - ultimately defined by governance through guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. This proposal affirms treasury NAV includes all stablecoins, ETH (including staked ETH and other derivatives), Swapr LPs or other liquidity provisioning instruments. It incorporates the value of other treasury assets (like SWPR, ENS, etc) with a pre-defined liquidity discount. The DXD-NAV ratio is the DXD circulating market cap (as defined in the last DXD buyback proposal) divided by the Treasury NAV. This will be calculated at least bi-weekly. The [latest version can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mS1sVmyP0Z3YiA1JiZpHgPHjSIh3da7MawpjQodE34Y/edit#gid=0).
* Inverse bonds - these will be individually launched according to specific parameters (duration, dividend stream, etc). The bonds should payout the % of NAV when they are due, not the NAV when the bond is issued or the DXD deposited. Bonds will need to have a redemption currency of either ETH or Dai/USDC.
* DXD Monetary Policy Committee is meant to involve engaged DXD holders in the formation of policy, but report preparation will need to be completed by DXdao contributors. Details of this will be further provided in the upcoming budget presentations by DXdao governance.
* DXdao may implement other tools to the DXD Monetary Policy Framework in addition to the four listed above. The goal is to incentivize an organic fair market for DXD with minimal open market operations and minimal changes to the underlying liquidity for the treasury.
* Execution of the price floor guarantee will occur on-chain through various trustless models. Previous DXD purchases were in smaller amounts, so executing on a larger scale will require more coordination.

This proposal requests 200k USDC as compensation for the [Exploit Disclosure - DXdao Governance](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625).

Overview: The exploit made use of a mismatch between the smart contract functionality and the front end implementations. By setting a `periods` variable when building a proposal manually, a user was able to set a multiplier on their proposal up to `2**256 - 1` (unit256). Allowing a proposal as innocuous as a rep boost to mint 99% of REP in the DAO, effectively turning the DAO into an EOA - as in being able to pass proposals / do transfers instantly.

Interesting fact, an unsigned integer with 256 bits (unit256), means a maximum value (i.e. multiplier) of 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 could have been set - where even 1 wei of REP minted would have made up over 99% of REP.

During June 2022, after the disclosure above, DXvote reflected periods in the UI. Thereby, making it easier to monitor and reduce risk of such a malicious proposal passing. Furthermore, there are ongoing efforts to add a validation check to the Contributor Scheme so it only accepts new proposals with a single period.

After discussion in the forum, on the weekly dev and governance call, as well as individual conversations with contributors and DXD holders, $200k appears to be an amount with support across the board. A [forum signal vote](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625/16) had 60+% votes over $200k and a [DXD snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hack24.eth/proposal/0x3fe5da3a2e700c13bad5482de17f6c17c59c54f24b023bf09f7811d5953499b3) 80+% in the $100k-$200k range.

Note that DLABS was in no way involved in the coding or auditing of the Contribution Scheme contract. In fact, both of these precede the incorporation of DLABS itself. 

This proposal pays $200k USDC to Decentral Labs LLC (DLABS) at dlabs.eth

QmV4uU6frapxa7Q5rHn4pYpJuLPhdn7CJgtQb2DcT2sihM,Approve New DXD Token Model,"
_Tldr: The DXD Token Working Group proposes a new token model, where “DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.”_

## Background

The DXD Bonding Curve was [launched in May of 2020](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xeb9cf2b3d76664dc1e983137f33b2400ad11966b1d79399d7ca55c25ad6283fa) by DXdao. The bonding curve was an effective fundraising tool but the mint/burn functions of the contract were never able to create a liquid market for DXD. In May 2021, DXdao [launched the DXD Buyback program](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) which purchased DXD off the open market using ETH from the general treasury as well as from the buyback reserve. The program [bought over 15,000 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit#gid=1629643942) (30% of circulating supply), but it was never viewed as a sustainable long-term model for DXD value accrual.

Since the bonding curve launched, DXdao has built and managed several DeFi and governance products, diversified its treasury into $10m+ of stablecoins, and has a team of 20+ full-time contributors focused on building and growing the DXdao ecosystem. The DXD token is at the center of this ecosystem, but there has not been a formal link between the value that DXdao creates and the DXD token. This creates uncertainty for DXD holders, especially as DXD has traded at a significant discount to book value.

In August 2022, DXdao [launched the DXD Token Working Group](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) to draft a long-term model for DXD. The below signal proposal is an output from the Working Group.

The proposal commits DXdao to:



* Introduce four tools in the DXD Monetary Policy Framework that would enable a fair and liquid market for DXD
* Establish a DXD Monetary Policy Committee
* Funding product development and other initiatives that further DXdao’s core mission to enable community freedom 

To further simplify and answer the question, “Why is DXD valuable?”, the WG affirms: **DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.**

## Details

**DXD Monetary Policy Framework**
This proposal establishes four tools to be used by DXdao governance under guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. These are:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee - DXdao commits to buying any amount of DXD on the open market 
* Inverse bonds - smart contracts where DXD can be deposited for a defined period of time in return for a certain % of DXdao treasury assets 
* New DXD minted - allow DXD to be minted in exchange for assets at full NAV
* Protocol-owned liquidity for DXD

**DXD Monetary Policy Committee**
Management of these tools requires close tracking of the DXD market as well as DXdao’s treasury. The committee should be at least three individuals and also include full-time contributors. This work should be compensated in vested DXD. The committee is tasked with:



* Providing quarterly reports on general general direction and outlook of DXD
* Issue monthly recommendations on inverse bond issuance and protocol-owned liquidity
* Work with DXdao governance and treasury on managing redemptions

**Product development funding**
DXdao’s mission is to enable community freedom. It was launched in 2019 as a radical experiment in decentralization. The DXD fundraiser was intended to raise funds for product development in line with this vision. The new token model represents a new social contract between REP & DXD holders. The DXD Token WG affirms DXdao’s commitment to building and funding decentralized products that enable community freedom by committing at least 6% of DXdao’s treasury to fund DXdao’s product & operations for a year.

This % can be changed at any time by governance and represents an overall budget suggestion for DXdao and is not a mandate to spend that amount, nor a maximum amount . This incentivizes the community to grow the size of the treasury.

## Implementation

This signal proposal is the output of the DXD Token Working Group, and if passed by REP & DXD holders, should be implemented by DXdao. Some of the elements will require significant development work before they can be put into practice. In the DXD Monetary Policy Framework, the DXD Floor Price Guarantee and the protocol-owned liquidity can be implemented using DXdao’s existing governance tools. 

This proposal commits to implement:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee priced at 70% of the current DXD-NAV Ratio (DXD's circulating market cap to Treasury NAV)
* Provide $250k in DXD/ETH on mainnet once DXD price hits 60% of Treasury NAV, another $250k deposit at 65%, and a $500k deposit when it hits 70% of NAV
* When ready, DXdao governance commits to issuing:
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 85% payout after 6 months will be issued, along with 
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 90% of NAV payout after one year, and
     - $1m in DXD Inverse bonds with 100% NAV payout after two years
* The current DXD token contract should be upgraded and the funds returned to the general treasury

## Definition and clarifications



* Treasury NAV - ultimately defined by governance through guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. This proposal affirms treasury NAV includes all stablecoins, ETH (including staked ETH and other derivatives), Swapr LPs or other liquidity provisioning instruments. It incorporates the value of other treasury assets (like SWPR, ENS, etc) with a pre-defined liquidity discount. The DXD-NAV ratio is the DXD circulating market cap (as defined in the last DXD buyback proposal) divided by the Treasury NAV. This will be calculated at least bi-weekly. The [latest version can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mS1sVmyP0Z3YiA1JiZpHgPHjSIh3da7MawpjQodE34Y/edit#gid=0).
* Inverse bonds - these will be individually launched according to specific parameters (duration, dividend stream, etc). The bonds should payout the % of NAV when they are due, not the NAV when the bond is issued or the DXD deposited. Bonds will need to have a redemption currency of either ETH or Dai/USDC.
* DXD Monetary Policy Committee is meant to involve engaged DXD holders in the formation of policy, but report preparation will need to be completed by DXdao contributors. Details of this will be further provided in the upcoming budget presentations by DXdao governance.
* DXdao may implement other tools to the DXD Monetary Policy Framework in addition to the four listed above. The goal is to incentivize an organic fair market for DXD with minimal open market operations and minimal changes to the underlying liquidity for the treasury.
* Execution of the price floor guarantee will occur on-chain through various trustless models. Previous DXD purchases were in smaller amounts, so executing on a larger scale will require more coordination.

This proposal requests 200k USDC as compensation for the [Exploit Disclosure - DXdao Governance](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625).

Overview: The exploit made use of a mismatch between the smart contract functionality and the front end implementations. By setting a `periods` variable when building a proposal manually, a user was able to set a multiplier on their proposal up to `2**256 - 1` (unit256). Allowing a proposal as innocuous as a rep boost to mint 99% of REP in the DAO, effectively turning the DAO into an EOA - as in being able to pass proposals / do transfers instantly.

Interesting fact, an unsigned integer with 256 bits (unit256), means a maximum value (i.e. multiplier) of 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 could have been set - where even 1 wei of REP minted would have made up over 99% of REP.

During June 2022, after the disclosure above, DXvote reflected periods in the UI. Thereby, making it easier to monitor and reduce risk of such a malicious proposal passing. Furthermore, there are ongoing efforts to add a validation check to the Contributor Scheme so it only accepts new proposals with a single period.

After discussion in the forum, on the weekly dev and governance call, as well as individual conversations with contributors and DXD holders, $200k appears to be an amount with support across the board. A [forum signal vote](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625/16) had 60+% votes over $200k and a [DXD snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hack24.eth/proposal/0x3fe5da3a2e700c13bad5482de17f6c17c59c54f24b023bf09f7811d5953499b3) 80+% in the $100k-$200k range.

Note that DLABS was in no way involved in the coding or auditing of the Contribution Scheme contract. In fact, both of these precede the incorporation of DLABS itself.

QmV4uU6frapxa7Q5rHn4pYpJuLPhdn7CJgtQb2DcT2sihM,Approve New DXD Token Model,"
_Tldr: The DXD Token Working Group proposes a new token model, where “DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.”_

## Background

The DXD Bonding Curve was [launched in May of 2020](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xeb9cf2b3d76664dc1e983137f33b2400ad11966b1d79399d7ca55c25ad6283fa) by DXdao. The bonding curve was an effective fundraising tool but the mint/burn functions of the contract were never able to create a liquid market for DXD. In May 2021, DXdao [launched the DXD Buyback program](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) which purchased DXD off the open market using ETH from the general treasury as well as from the buyback reserve. The program [bought over 15,000 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit#gid=1629643942) (30% of circulating supply), but it was never viewed as a sustainable long-term model for DXD value accrual.

Since the bonding curve launched, DXdao has built and managed several DeFi and governance products, diversified its treasury into $10m+ of stablecoins, and has a team of 20+ full-time contributors focused on building and growing the DXdao ecosystem. The DXD token is at the center of this ecosystem, but there has not been a formal link between the value that DXdao creates and the DXD token. This creates uncertainty for DXD holders, especially as DXD has traded at a significant discount to book value.

In August 2022, DXdao [launched the DXD Token Working Group](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) to draft a long-term model for DXD. The below signal proposal is an output from the Working Group.

The proposal commits DXdao to:



* Introduce four tools in the DXD Monetary Policy Framework that would enable a fair and liquid market for DXD
* Establish a DXD Monetary Policy Committee
* Funding product development and other initiatives that further DXdao’s core mission to enable community freedom 

To further simplify and answer the question, “Why is DXD valuable?”, the WG affirms: **DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.**

## Details

**DXD Monetary Policy Framework**
This proposal establishes four tools to be used by DXdao governance under guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. These are:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee - DXdao commits to buying any amount of DXD on the open market 
* Inverse bonds - smart contracts where DXD can be deposited for a defined period of time in return for a certain % of DXdao treasury assets 
* New DXD minted - allow DXD to be minted in exchange for assets at full NAV
* Protocol-owned liquidity for DXD

**DXD Monetary Policy Committee**
Management of these tools requires close tracking of the DXD market as well as DXdao’s treasury. The committee should be at least three individuals and also include full-time contributors. This work should be compensated in vested DXD. The committee is tasked with:



* Providing quarterly reports on general general direction and outlook of DXD
* Issue monthly recommendations on inverse bond issuance and protocol-owned liquidity
* Work with DXdao governance and treasury on managing redemptions

**Product development funding**
DXdao’s mission is to enable community freedom. It was launched in 2019 as a radical experiment in decentralization. The DXD fundraiser was intended to raise funds for product development in line with this vision. The new token model represents a new social contract between REP & DXD holders. The DXD Token WG affirms DXdao’s commitment to building and funding decentralized products that enable community freedom by committing at least 6% of DXdao’s treasury to fund DXdao’s product & operations for a year.

This % can be changed at any time by governance and represents an overall budget suggestion for DXdao and is not a mandate to spend that amount, nor a maximum amount . This incentivizes the community to grow the size of the treasury.

## Implementation

This signal proposal is the output of the DXD Token Working Group, and if passed by REP & DXD holders, should be implemented by DXdao. Some of the elements will require significant development work before they can be put into practice. In the DXD Monetary Policy Framework, the DXD Floor Price Guarantee and the protocol-owned liquidity can be implemented using DXdao’s existing governance tools. 

This proposal commits to implement:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee priced at 70% of the current DXD-NAV Ratio (DXD's circulating market cap to Treasury NAV)
* Provide $250k in DXD/ETH on mainnet once DXD price hits 60% of Treasury NAV, another $250k deposit at 65%, and a $500k deposit when it hits 70% of NAV
* When ready, DXdao governance commits to issuing:
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 85% payout after 6 months will be issued, along with 
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 90% of NAV payout after one year, and
     - $1m in DXD Inverse bonds with 100% NAV payout after two years
* The current DXD token contract should be upgraded and the funds returned to the general treasury

## Definition and clarifications



* Treasury NAV - ultimately defined by governance through guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. This proposal affirms treasury NAV includes all stablecoins, ETH (including staked ETH and other derivatives), Swapr LPs or other liquidity provisioning instruments. It incorporates the value of other treasury assets (like SWPR, ENS, etc) with a pre-defined liquidity discount. The DXD-NAV ratio is the DXD circulating market cap (as defined in the last DXD buyback proposal) divided by the Treasury NAV. This will be calculated at least bi-weekly. The [latest version can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mS1sVmyP0Z3YiA1JiZpHgPHjSIh3da7MawpjQodE34Y/edit#gid=0).
* Inverse bonds - these will be individually launched according to specific parameters (duration, dividend stream, etc). The bonds should payout the % of NAV when they are due, not the NAV when the bond is issued or the DXD deposited. Bonds will need to have a redemption currency of either ETH or Dai/USDC.
* DXD Monetary Policy Committee is meant to involve engaged DXD holders in the formation of policy, but report preparation will need to be completed by DXdao contributors. Details of this will be further provided in the upcoming budget presentations by DXdao governance.
* DXdao may implement other tools to the DXD Monetary Policy Framework in addition to the four listed above. The goal is to incentivize an organic fair market for DXD with minimal open market operations and minimal changes to the underlying liquidity for the treasury.
* Execution of the price floor guarantee will occur on-chain through various trustless models. Previous DXD purchases were in smaller amounts, so executing on a larger scale will require more coordination.

This proposal requests 200k USDC as compensation for the [Exploit Disclosure - DXdao Governance](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625).

Overview: The exploit made use of a mismatch between the smart contract functionality and the front end implementations. By setting a `periods` variable when building a proposal manually, a user was able to set a multiplier on their proposal up to `2**256 - 1` (unit256). Allowing a proposal as innocuous as a rep boost to mint 99% of REP in the DAO, effectively turning the DAO into an EOA - as in being able to pass proposals / do transfers instantly.

Interesting fact, an unsigned integer with 256 bits (unit256), means a maximum value (i.e. multiplier) of 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 could have been set - where even 1 wei of REP minted would have made up over 99% of REP.

During June 2022, after the disclosure above, DXvote reflected periods in the UI. Thereby, making it easier to monitor and reduce risk of such a malicious proposal passing. Furthermore, there are ongoing efforts to add a validation check to the Contributor Scheme so it only accepts new proposals with a single period.

After discussion in the forum, on the weekly dev and governance call, as well as individual conversations with contributors and DXD holders, $200k appears to be an amount with support across the board. A [forum signal vote](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625/16) had 60+% votes over $200k and a [DXD snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hack24.eth/proposal/0x3fe5da3a2e700c13bad5482de17f6c17c59c54f24b023bf09f7811d5953499b3) 80+% in the $100k-$200k range.

Note that DLABS was in no way involved in the coding or auditing of the Contribution Scheme contract. In fact, both of these precede the incorporation of DLABS itself. 

This proposal pays $200k USDC to Decentral Labs LLC (DLABS) at dlabs.eth

QmV4uU6frapxa7Q5rHn4pYpJuLPhdn7CJgtQb2DcT2sihM,Approve New DXD Token Model,"
_Tldr: The DXD Token Working Group proposes a new token model, where “DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.”_

## Background

The DXD Bonding Curve was [launched in May of 2020](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xeb9cf2b3d76664dc1e983137f33b2400ad11966b1d79399d7ca55c25ad6283fa) by DXdao. The bonding curve was an effective fundraising tool but the mint/burn functions of the contract were never able to create a liquid market for DXD. In May 2021, DXdao [launched the DXD Buyback program](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) which purchased DXD off the open market using ETH from the general treasury as well as from the buyback reserve. The program [bought over 15,000 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit#gid=1629643942) (30% of circulating supply), but it was never viewed as a sustainable long-term model for DXD value accrual.

Since the bonding curve launched, DXdao has built and managed several DeFi and governance products, diversified its treasury into $10m+ of stablecoins, and has a team of 20+ full-time contributors focused on building and growing the DXdao ecosystem. The DXD token is at the center of this ecosystem, but there has not been a formal link between the value that DXdao creates and the DXD token. This creates uncertainty for DXD holders, especially as DXD has traded at a significant discount to book value.

In August 2022, DXdao [launched the DXD Token Working Group](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) to draft a long-term model for DXD. The below signal proposal is an output from the Working Group.

The proposal commits DXdao to:



* Introduce four tools in the DXD Monetary Policy Framework that would enable a fair and liquid market for DXD
* Establish a DXD Monetary Policy Committee
* Funding product development and other initiatives that further DXdao’s core mission to enable community freedom 

To further simplify and answer the question, “Why is DXD valuable?”, the WG affirms: **DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.**

## Details

**DXD Monetary Policy Framework**
This proposal establishes four tools to be used by DXdao governance under guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. These are:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee - DXdao commits to buying any amount of DXD on the open market 
* Inverse bonds - smart contracts where DXD can be deposited for a defined period of time in return for a certain % of DXdao treasury assets 
* New DXD minted - allow DXD to be minted in exchange for assets at full NAV
* Protocol-owned liquidity for DXD

**DXD Monetary Policy Committee**
Management of these tools requires close tracking of the DXD market as well as DXdao’s treasury. The committee should be at least three individuals and also include full-time contributors. This work should be compensated in vested DXD. The committee is tasked with:



* Providing quarterly reports on general general direction and outlook of DXD
* Issue monthly recommendations on inverse bond issuance and protocol-owned liquidity
* Work with DXdao governance and treasury on managing redemptions

**Product development funding**
DXdao’s mission is to enable community freedom. It was launched in 2019 as a radical experiment in decentralization. The DXD fundraiser was intended to raise funds for product development in line with this vision. The new token model represents a new social contract between REP & DXD holders. The DXD Token WG affirms DXdao’s commitment to building and funding decentralized products that enable community freedom by committing at least 6% of DXdao’s treasury to fund DXdao’s product & operations for a year.

This % can be changed at any time by governance and represents an overall budget suggestion for DXdao and is not a mandate to spend that amount, nor a maximum amount . This incentivizes the community to grow the size of the treasury.

## Implementation

This signal proposal is the output of the DXD Token Working Group, and if passed by REP & DXD holders, should be implemented by DXdao. Some of the elements will require significant development work before they can be put into practice. In the DXD Monetary Policy Framework, the DXD Floor Price Guarantee and the protocol-owned liquidity can be implemented using DXdao’s existing governance tools. 

This proposal commits to implement:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee priced at 70% of the current DXD-NAV Ratio (DXD's circulating market cap to Treasury NAV)
* Provide $250k in DXD/ETH on mainnet once DXD price hits 60% of Treasury NAV, another $250k deposit at 65%, and a $500k deposit when it hits 70% of NAV
* When ready, DXdao governance commits to issuing:
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 85% payout after 6 months will be issued, along with 
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 90% of NAV payout after one year, and
     - $1m in DXD Inverse bonds with 100% NAV payout after two years
* The current DXD token contract should be upgraded and the funds returned to the general treasury

## Definition and clarifications



* Treasury NAV - ultimately defined by governance through guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. This proposal affirms treasury NAV includes all stablecoins, ETH (including staked ETH and other derivatives), Swapr LPs or other liquidity provisioning instruments. It incorporates the value of other treasury assets (like SWPR, ENS, etc) with a pre-defined liquidity discount. The DXD-NAV ratio is the DXD circulating market cap (as defined in the last DXD buyback proposal) divided by the Treasury NAV. This will be calculated at least bi-weekly. The [latest version can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mS1sVmyP0Z3YiA1JiZpHgPHjSIh3da7MawpjQodE34Y/edit#gid=0).
* Inverse bonds - these will be individually launched according to specific parameters (duration, dividend stream, etc). The bonds should payout the % of NAV when they are due, not the NAV when the bond is issued or the DXD deposited. Bonds will need to have a redemption currency of either ETH or Dai/USDC.
* DXD Monetary Policy Committee is meant to involve engaged DXD holders in the formation of policy, but report preparation will need to be completed by DXdao contributors. Details of this will be further provided in the upcoming budget presentations by DXdao governance.
* DXdao may implement other tools to the DXD Monetary Policy Framework in addition to the four listed above. The goal is to incentivize an organic fair market for DXD with minimal open market operations and minimal changes to the underlying liquidity for the treasury.
* Execution of the price floor guarantee will occur on-chain through various trustless models. Previous DXD purchases were in smaller amounts, so executing on a larger scale will require more coordination.

This proposal requests 200k USDC as compensation for the [Exploit Disclosure - DXdao Governance](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625).

Overview: The exploit made use of a mismatch between the smart contract functionality and the front end implementations. By setting a `periods` variable when building a proposal manually, a user was able to set a multiplier on their proposal up to `2**256 - 1` (unit256). Allowing a proposal as innocuous as a rep boost to mint 99% of REP in the DAO, effectively turning the DAO into an EOA - as in being able to pass proposals / do transfers instantly.

Interesting fact, an unsigned integer with 256 bits (unit256), means a maximum value (i.e. multiplier) of 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 could have been set - where even 1 wei of REP minted would have made up over 99% of REP.

During June 2022, after the disclosure above, DXvote reflected periods in the UI. Thereby, making it easier to monitor and reduce risk of such a malicious proposal passing. Furthermore, there are ongoing efforts to add a validation check to the Contributor Scheme so it only accepts new proposals with a single period.

After discussion in the forum, on the weekly dev and governance call, as well as individual conversations with contributors and DXD holders, $200k appears to be an amount with support across the board. A [forum signal vote](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625/16) had 60+% votes over $200k and a [DXD snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hack24.eth/proposal/0x3fe5da3a2e700c13bad5482de17f6c17c59c54f24b023bf09f7811d5953499b3) 80+% in the $100k-$200k range.

Note that DLABS was in no way involved in the coding or auditing of the Contribution Scheme contract. In fact, both of these precede the incorporation of DLABS itself.

QmV4uU6frapxa7Q5rHn4pYpJuLPhdn7CJgtQb2DcT2sihM,Approve New DXD Token Model,"
_Tldr: The DXD Token Working Group proposes a new token model, where “DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.”_

## Background

The DXD Bonding Curve was [launched in May of 2020](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xeb9cf2b3d76664dc1e983137f33b2400ad11966b1d79399d7ca55c25ad6283fa) by DXdao. The bonding curve was an effective fundraising tool but the mint/burn functions of the contract were never able to create a liquid market for DXD. In May 2021, DXdao [launched the DXD Buyback program](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) which purchased DXD off the open market using ETH from the general treasury as well as from the buyback reserve. The program [bought over 15,000 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit#gid=1629643942) (30% of circulating supply), but it was never viewed as a sustainable long-term model for DXD value accrual.

Since the bonding curve launched, DXdao has built and managed several DeFi and governance products, diversified its treasury into $10m+ of stablecoins, and has a team of 20+ full-time contributors focused on building and growing the DXdao ecosystem. The DXD token is at the center of this ecosystem, but there has not been a formal link between the value that DXdao creates and the DXD token. This creates uncertainty for DXD holders, especially as DXD has traded at a significant discount to book value.

In August 2022, DXdao [launched the DXD Token Working Group](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) to draft a long-term model for DXD. The below signal proposal is an output from the Working Group.

The proposal commits DXdao to:



* Introduce four tools in the DXD Monetary Policy Framework that would enable a fair and liquid market for DXD
* Establish a DXD Monetary Policy Committee
* Funding product development and other initiatives that further DXdao’s core mission to enable community freedom 

To further simplify and answer the question, “Why is DXD valuable?”, the WG affirms: **DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.**

## Details

**DXD Monetary Policy Framework**
This proposal establishes four tools to be used by DXdao governance under guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. These are:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee - DXdao commits to buying any amount of DXD on the open market 
* Inverse bonds - smart contracts where DXD can be deposited for a defined period of time in return for a certain % of DXdao treasury assets 
* New DXD minted - allow DXD to be minted in exchange for assets at full NAV
* Protocol-owned liquidity for DXD

**DXD Monetary Policy Committee**
Management of these tools requires close tracking of the DXD market as well as DXdao’s treasury. The committee should be at least three individuals and also include full-time contributors. This work should be compensated in vested DXD. The committee is tasked with:



* Providing quarterly reports on general general direction and outlook of DXD
* Issue monthly recommendations on inverse bond issuance and protocol-owned liquidity
* Work with DXdao governance and treasury on managing redemptions

**Product development funding**
DXdao’s mission is to enable community freedom. It was launched in 2019 as a radical experiment in decentralization. The DXD fundraiser was intended to raise funds for product development in line with this vision. The new token model represents a new social contract between REP & DXD holders. The DXD Token WG affirms DXdao’s commitment to building and funding decentralized products that enable community freedom by committing at least 6% of DXdao’s treasury to fund DXdao’s product & operations for a year.

This % can be changed at any time by governance and represents an overall budget suggestion for DXdao and is not a mandate to spend that amount, nor a maximum amount . This incentivizes the community to grow the size of the treasury.

## Implementation

This signal proposal is the output of the DXD Token Working Group, and if passed by REP & DXD holders, should be implemented by DXdao. Some of the elements will require significant development work before they can be put into practice. In the DXD Monetary Policy Framework, the DXD Floor Price Guarantee and the protocol-owned liquidity can be implemented using DXdao’s existing governance tools. 

This proposal commits to implement:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee priced at 70% of the current DXD-NAV Ratio (DXD's circulating market cap to Treasury NAV)
* Provide $250k in DXD/ETH on mainnet once DXD price hits 60% of Treasury NAV, another $250k deposit at 65%, and a $500k deposit when it hits 70% of NAV
* When ready, DXdao governance commits to issuing:
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 85% payout after 6 months will be issued, along with 
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 90% of NAV payout after one year, and
     - $1m in DXD Inverse bonds with 100% NAV payout after two years
* The current DXD token contract should be upgraded and the funds returned to the general treasury

## Definition and clarifications



* Treasury NAV - ultimately defined by governance through guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. This proposal affirms treasury NAV includes all stablecoins, ETH (including staked ETH and other derivatives), Swapr LPs or other liquidity provisioning instruments. It incorporates the value of other treasury assets (like SWPR, ENS, etc) with a pre-defined liquidity discount. The DXD-NAV ratio is the DXD circulating market cap (as defined in the last DXD buyback proposal) divided by the Treasury NAV. This will be calculated at least bi-weekly. The [latest version can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mS1sVmyP0Z3YiA1JiZpHgPHjSIh3da7MawpjQodE34Y/edit#gid=0).
* Inverse bonds - these will be individually launched according to specific parameters (duration, dividend stream, etc). The bonds should payout the % of NAV when they are due, not the NAV when the bond is issued or the DXD deposited. Bonds will need to have a redemption currency of either ETH or Dai/USDC.
* DXD Monetary Policy Committee is meant to involve engaged DXD holders in the formation of policy, but report preparation will need to be completed by DXdao contributors. Details of this will be further provided in the upcoming budget presentations by DXdao governance.
* DXdao may implement other tools to the DXD Monetary Policy Framework in addition to the four listed above. The goal is to incentivize an organic fair market for DXD with minimal open market operations and minimal changes to the underlying liquidity for the treasury.
* Execution of the price floor guarantee will occur on-chain through various trustless models. Previous DXD purchases were in smaller amounts, so executing on a larger scale will require more coordination.

This proposal requests 200k USDC as compensation for the [Exploit Disclosure - DXdao Governance](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625).

Overview: The exploit made use of a mismatch between the smart contract functionality and the front end implementations. By setting a `periods` variable when building a proposal manually, a user was able to set a multiplier on their proposal up to `2**256 - 1` (unit256). Allowing a proposal as innocuous as a rep boost to mint 99% of REP in the DAO, effectively turning the DAO into an EOA - as in being able to pass proposals / do transfers instantly.

Interesting fact, an unsigned integer with 256 bits (unit256), means a maximum value (i.e. multiplier) of 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 could have been set - where even 1 wei of REP minted would have made up over 99% of REP.

During June 2022, after the disclosure above, DXvote reflected periods in the UI. Thereby, making it easier to monitor and reduce risk of such a malicious proposal passing. Furthermore, there are ongoing efforts to add a validation check to the Contributor Scheme so it only accepts new proposals with a single period.

After discussion in the forum, on the weekly dev and governance call, as well as individual conversations with contributors and DXD holders, $200k appears to be an amount with support across the board. A [forum signal vote](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625/16) had 60+% votes over $200k and a [DXD snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hack24.eth/proposal/0x3fe5da3a2e700c13bad5482de17f6c17c59c54f24b023bf09f7811d5953499b3) 80+% in the $100k-$200k range.

Note that DLABS was in no way involved in the coding or auditing of the Contribution Scheme contract. In fact, both of these precede the incorporation of DLABS itself. 

This proposal pays $200k USDC to Decentral Labs LLC (DLABS) at dlabs.eth

QmV4uU6frapxa7Q5rHn4pYpJuLPhdn7CJgtQb2DcT2sihM,Approve New DXD Token Model,"
_Tldr: The DXD Token Working Group proposes a new token model, where “DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.”_

## Background

The DXD Bonding Curve was [launched in May of 2020](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xeb9cf2b3d76664dc1e983137f33b2400ad11966b1d79399d7ca55c25ad6283fa) by DXdao. The bonding curve was an effective fundraising tool but the mint/burn functions of the contract were never able to create a liquid market for DXD. In May 2021, DXdao [launched the DXD Buyback program](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) which purchased DXD off the open market using ETH from the general treasury as well as from the buyback reserve. The program [bought over 15,000 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit#gid=1629643942) (30% of circulating supply), but it was never viewed as a sustainable long-term model for DXD value accrual.

Since the bonding curve launched, DXdao has built and managed several DeFi and governance products, diversified its treasury into $10m+ of stablecoins, and has a team of 20+ full-time contributors focused on building and growing the DXdao ecosystem. The DXD token is at the center of this ecosystem, but there has not been a formal link between the value that DXdao creates and the DXD token. This creates uncertainty for DXD holders, especially as DXD has traded at a significant discount to book value.

In August 2022, DXdao [launched the DXD Token Working Group](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) to draft a long-term model for DXD. The below signal proposal is an output from the Working Group.

The proposal commits DXdao to:



* Introduce four tools in the DXD Monetary Policy Framework that would enable a fair and liquid market for DXD
* Establish a DXD Monetary Policy Committee
* Funding product development and other initiatives that further DXdao’s core mission to enable community freedom 

To further simplify and answer the question, “Why is DXD valuable?”, the WG affirms: **DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.**

## Details

**DXD Monetary Policy Framework**
This proposal establishes four tools to be used by DXdao governance under guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. These are:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee - DXdao commits to buying any amount of DXD on the open market 
* Inverse bonds - smart contracts where DXD can be deposited for a defined period of time in return for a certain % of DXdao treasury assets 
* New DXD minted - allow DXD to be minted in exchange for assets at full NAV
* Protocol-owned liquidity for DXD

**DXD Monetary Policy Committee**
Management of these tools requires close tracking of the DXD market as well as DXdao’s treasury. The committee should be at least three individuals and also include full-time contributors. This work should be compensated in vested DXD. The committee is tasked with:



* Providing quarterly reports on general general direction and outlook of DXD
* Issue monthly recommendations on inverse bond issuance and protocol-owned liquidity
* Work with DXdao governance and treasury on managing redemptions

**Product development funding**
DXdao’s mission is to enable community freedom. It was launched in 2019 as a radical experiment in decentralization. The DXD fundraiser was intended to raise funds for product development in line with this vision. The new token model represents a new social contract between REP & DXD holders. The DXD Token WG affirms DXdao’s commitment to building and funding decentralized products that enable community freedom by committing at least 6% of DXdao’s treasury to fund DXdao’s product & operations for a year.

This % can be changed at any time by governance and represents an overall budget suggestion for DXdao and is not a mandate to spend that amount, nor a maximum amount . This incentivizes the community to grow the size of the treasury.

## Implementation

This signal proposal is the output of the DXD Token Working Group, and if passed by REP & DXD holders, should be implemented by DXdao. Some of the elements will require significant development work before they can be put into practice. In the DXD Monetary Policy Framework, the DXD Floor Price Guarantee and the protocol-owned liquidity can be implemented using DXdao’s existing governance tools. 

This proposal commits to implement:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee priced at 70% of the current DXD-NAV Ratio (DXD's circulating market cap to Treasury NAV)
* Provide $250k in DXD/ETH on mainnet once DXD price hits 60% of Treasury NAV, another $250k deposit at 65%, and a $500k deposit when it hits 70% of NAV
* When ready, DXdao governance commits to issuing:
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 85% payout after 6 months will be issued, along with 
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 90% of NAV payout after one year, and
     - $1m in DXD Inverse bonds with 100% NAV payout after two years
* The current DXD token contract should be upgraded and the funds returned to the general treasury

## Definition and clarifications



* Treasury NAV - ultimately defined by governance through guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. This proposal affirms treasury NAV includes all stablecoins, ETH (including staked ETH and other derivatives), Swapr LPs or other liquidity provisioning instruments. It incorporates the value of other treasury assets (like SWPR, ENS, etc) with a pre-defined liquidity discount. The DXD-NAV ratio is the DXD circulating market cap (as defined in the last DXD buyback proposal) divided by the Treasury NAV. This will be calculated at least bi-weekly. The [latest version can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mS1sVmyP0Z3YiA1JiZpHgPHjSIh3da7MawpjQodE34Y/edit#gid=0).
* Inverse bonds - these will be individually launched according to specific parameters (duration, dividend stream, etc). The bonds should payout the % of NAV when they are due, not the NAV when the bond is issued or the DXD deposited. Bonds will need to have a redemption currency of either ETH or Dai/USDC.
* DXD Monetary Policy Committee is meant to involve engaged DXD holders in the formation of policy, but report preparation will need to be completed by DXdao contributors. Details of this will be further provided in the upcoming budget presentations by DXdao governance.
* DXdao may implement other tools to the DXD Monetary Policy Framework in addition to the four listed above. The goal is to incentivize an organic fair market for DXD with minimal open market operations and minimal changes to the underlying liquidity for the treasury.
* Execution of the price floor guarantee will occur on-chain through various trustless models. Previous DXD purchases were in smaller amounts, so executing on a larger scale will require more coordination.

This proposal requests 200k USDC as compensation for the [Exploit Disclosure - DXdao Governance](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625).

Overview: The exploit made use of a mismatch between the smart contract functionality and the front end implementations. By setting a `periods` variable when building a proposal manually, a user was able to set a multiplier on their proposal up to `2**256 - 1` (unit256). Allowing a proposal as innocuous as a rep boost to mint 99% of REP in the DAO, effectively turning the DAO into an EOA - as in being able to pass proposals / do transfers instantly.

Interesting fact, an unsigned integer with 256 bits (unit256), means a maximum value (i.e. multiplier) of 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 could have been set - where even 1 wei of REP minted would have made up over 99% of REP.

During June 2022, after the disclosure above, DXvote reflected periods in the UI. Thereby, making it easier to monitor and reduce risk of such a malicious proposal passing. Furthermore, there are ongoing efforts to add a validation check to the Contributor Scheme so it only accepts new proposals with a single period.

After discussion in the forum, on the weekly dev and governance call, as well as individual conversations with contributors and DXD holders, $200k appears to be an amount with support across the board. A [forum signal vote](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625/16) had 60+% votes over $200k and a [DXD snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hack24.eth/proposal/0x3fe5da3a2e700c13bad5482de17f6c17c59c54f24b023bf09f7811d5953499b3) 80+% in the $100k-$200k range.

Note that DLABS was in no way involved in the coding or auditing of the Contribution Scheme contract. In fact, both of these precede the incorporation of DLABS itself. 

This proposal pays $200k USDC to Decentral Labs LLC (DLABS) at dlabs.eth

QmV4uU6frapxa7Q5rHn4pYpJuLPhdn7CJgtQb2DcT2sihM,Approve New DXD Token Model,"
_Tldr: The DXD Token Working Group proposes a new token model, where “DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.”_

## Background

The DXD Bonding Curve was [launched in May of 2020](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xeb9cf2b3d76664dc1e983137f33b2400ad11966b1d79399d7ca55c25ad6283fa) by DXdao. The bonding curve was an effective fundraising tool but the mint/burn functions of the contract were never able to create a liquid market for DXD. In May 2021, DXdao [launched the DXD Buyback program](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) which purchased DXD off the open market using ETH from the general treasury as well as from the buyback reserve. The program [bought over 15,000 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit#gid=1629643942) (30% of circulating supply), but it was never viewed as a sustainable long-term model for DXD value accrual.

Since the bonding curve launched, DXdao has built and managed several DeFi and governance products, diversified its treasury into $10m+ of stablecoins, and has a team of 20+ full-time contributors focused on building and growing the DXdao ecosystem. The DXD token is at the center of this ecosystem, but there has not been a formal link between the value that DXdao creates and the DXD token. This creates uncertainty for DXD holders, especially as DXD has traded at a significant discount to book value.

In August 2022, DXdao [launched the DXD Token Working Group](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) to draft a long-term model for DXD. The below signal proposal is an output from the Working Group.

The proposal commits DXdao to:



* Introduce four tools in the DXD Monetary Policy Framework that would enable a fair and liquid market for DXD
* Establish a DXD Monetary Policy Committee
* Funding product development and other initiatives that further DXdao’s core mission to enable community freedom 

To further simplify and answer the question, “Why is DXD valuable?”, the WG affirms: **DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.**

## Details

**DXD Monetary Policy Framework**
This proposal establishes four tools to be used by DXdao governance under guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. These are:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee - DXdao commits to buying any amount of DXD on the open market 
* Inverse bonds - smart contracts where DXD can be deposited for a defined period of time in return for a certain % of DXdao treasury assets 
* New DXD minted - allow DXD to be minted in exchange for assets at full NAV
* Protocol-owned liquidity for DXD

**DXD Monetary Policy Committee**
Management of these tools requires close tracking of the DXD market as well as DXdao’s treasury. The committee should be at least three individuals and also include full-time contributors. This work should be compensated in vested DXD. The committee is tasked with:



* Providing quarterly reports on general general direction and outlook of DXD
* Issue monthly recommendations on inverse bond issuance and protocol-owned liquidity
* Work with DXdao governance and treasury on managing redemptions

**Product development funding**
DXdao’s mission is to enable community freedom. It was launched in 2019 as a radical experiment in decentralization. The DXD fundraiser was intended to raise funds for product development in line with this vision. The new token model represents a new social contract between REP & DXD holders. The DXD Token WG affirms DXdao’s commitment to building and funding decentralized products that enable community freedom by committing at least 6% of DXdao’s treasury to fund DXdao’s product & operations for a year.

This % can be changed at any time by governance and represents an overall budget suggestion for DXdao and is not a mandate to spend that amount, nor a maximum amount . This incentivizes the community to grow the size of the treasury.

## Implementation

This signal proposal is the output of the DXD Token Working Group, and if passed by REP & DXD holders, should be implemented by DXdao. Some of the elements will require significant development work before they can be put into practice. In the DXD Monetary Policy Framework, the DXD Floor Price Guarantee and the protocol-owned liquidity can be implemented using DXdao’s existing governance tools. 

This proposal commits to implement:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee priced at 70% of the current DXD-NAV Ratio (DXD's circulating market cap to Treasury NAV)
* Provide $250k in DXD/ETH on mainnet once DXD price hits 60% of Treasury NAV, another $250k deposit at 65%, and a $500k deposit when it hits 70% of NAV
* When ready, DXdao governance commits to issuing:
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 85% payout after 6 months will be issued, along with 
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 90% of NAV payout after one year, and
     - $1m in DXD Inverse bonds with 100% NAV payout after two years
* The current DXD token contract should be upgraded and the funds returned to the general treasury

## Definition and clarifications



* Treasury NAV - ultimately defined by governance through guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. This proposal affirms treasury NAV includes all stablecoins, ETH (including staked ETH and other derivatives), Swapr LPs or other liquidity provisioning instruments. It incorporates the value of other treasury assets (like SWPR, ENS, etc) with a pre-defined liquidity discount. The DXD-NAV ratio is the DXD circulating market cap (as defined in the last DXD buyback proposal) divided by the Treasury NAV. This will be calculated at least bi-weekly. The [latest version can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mS1sVmyP0Z3YiA1JiZpHgPHjSIh3da7MawpjQodE34Y/edit#gid=0).
* Inverse bonds - these will be individually launched according to specific parameters (duration, dividend stream, etc). The bonds should payout the % of NAV when they are due, not the NAV when the bond is issued or the DXD deposited. Bonds will need to have a redemption currency of either ETH or Dai/USDC.
* DXD Monetary Policy Committee is meant to involve engaged DXD holders in the formation of policy, but report preparation will need to be completed by DXdao contributors. Details of this will be further provided in the upcoming budget presentations by DXdao governance.
* DXdao may implement other tools to the DXD Monetary Policy Framework in addition to the four listed above. The goal is to incentivize an organic fair market for DXD with minimal open market operations and minimal changes to the underlying liquidity for the treasury.
* Execution of the price floor guarantee will occur on-chain through various trustless models. Previous DXD purchases were in smaller amounts, so executing on a larger scale will require more coordination.

This proposal requests 200k USDC as compensation for the [Exploit Disclosure - DXdao Governance](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625).

Overview: The exploit made use of a mismatch between the smart contract functionality and the front end implementations. By setting a `periods` variable when building a proposal manually, a user was able to set a multiplier on their proposal up to `2**256 - 1` (unit256). Allowing a proposal as innocuous as a rep boost to mint 99% of REP in the DAO, effectively turning the DAO into an EOA - as in being able to pass proposals / do transfers instantly.

Interesting fact, an unsigned integer with 256 bits (unit256), means a maximum value (i.e. multiplier) of 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 could have been set - where even 1 wei of REP minted would have made up over 99% of REP.

During June 2022, after the disclosure above, DXvote reflected periods in the UI. Thereby, making it easier to monitor and reduce risk of such a malicious proposal passing. Furthermore, there are ongoing efforts to add a validation check to the Contributor Scheme so it only accepts new proposals with a single period.

After discussion in the forum, on the weekly dev and governance call, as well as individual conversations with contributors and DXD holders, $200k appears to be an amount with support across the board. A [forum signal vote](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625/16) had 60+% votes over $200k and a [DXD snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hack24.eth/proposal/0x3fe5da3a2e700c13bad5482de17f6c17c59c54f24b023bf09f7811d5953499b3) 80+% in the $100k-$200k range.

Note that DLABS was in no way involved in the coding or auditing of the Contribution Scheme contract. In fact, both of these precede the incorporation of DLABS itself. 

This proposal pays $200k USDC to Decentral Labs LLC (DLABS) at dlabs.eth

_Tldr: The DXD Token Working Group proposes a new token model, where “DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.”_

## Background

The DXD Bonding Curve was [launched in May of 2020](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xeb9cf2b3d76664dc1e983137f33b2400ad11966b1d79399d7ca55c25ad6283fa) by DXdao. The bonding curve was an effective fundraising tool but the mint/burn functions of the contract were never able to create a liquid market for DXD. In May 2021, DXdao [launched the DXD Buyback program](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) which purchased DXD off the open market using ETH from the general treasury as well as from the buyback reserve. The program [bought over 15,000 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit#gid=1629643942) (30% of circulating supply), but it was never viewed as a sustainable long-term model for DXD value accrual.

Since the bonding curve launched, DXdao has built and managed several DeFi and governance products, diversified its treasury into $10m+ of stablecoins, and has a team of 20+ full-time contributors focused on building and growing the DXdao ecosystem. The DXD token is at the center of this ecosystem, but there has not been a formal link between the value that DXdao creates and the DXD token. This creates uncertainty for DXD holders, especially as DXD has traded at a significant discount to book value.

In August 2022, DXdao [launched the DXD Token Working Group](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) to draft a long-term model for DXD. The below signal proposal is an output from the Working Group.

The proposal commits DXdao to:



* Introduce four tools in the DXD Monetary Policy Framework that would enable a fair and liquid market for DXD
* Establish a DXD Monetary Policy Committee
* Funding product development and other initiatives that further DXdao’s core mission to enable community freedom 

To further simplify and answer the question, “Why is DXD valuable?”, the WG affirms: **DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.**

## Details

**DXD Monetary Policy Framework**
This proposal establishes four tools to be used by DXdao governance under guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. These are:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee - DXdao commits to buying any amount of DXD on the open market 
* Inverse bonds - smart contracts where DXD can be deposited for a defined period of time in return for a certain % of DXdao treasury assets 
* New DXD minted - allow DXD to be minted in exchange for assets at full NAV
* Protocol-owned liquidity for DXD

**DXD Monetary Policy Committee**
Management of these tools requires close tracking of the DXD market as well as DXdao’s treasury. The committee should be at least three individuals and also include full-time contributors. This work should be compensated in vested DXD. The committee is tasked with:



* Providing quarterly reports on general general direction and outlook of DXD
* Issue monthly recommendations on inverse bond issuance and protocol-owned liquidity
* Work with DXdao governance and treasury on managing redemptions

**Product development funding**
DXdao’s mission is to enable community freedom. It was launched in 2019 as a radical experiment in decentralization. The DXD fundraiser was intended to raise funds for product development in line with this vision. The new token model represents a new social contract between REP & DXD holders. The DXD Token WG affirms DXdao’s commitment to building and funding decentralized products that enable community freedom by committing at least 6% of DXdao’s treasury to fund DXdao’s product & operations for a year.

This % can be changed at any time by governance and represents an overall budget suggestion for DXdao and is not a mandate to spend that amount, nor a maximum amount . This incentivizes the community to grow the size of the treasury.

## Implementation

This signal proposal is the output of the DXD Token Working Group, and if passed by REP & DXD holders, should be implemented by DXdao. Some of the elements will require significant development work before they can be put into practice. In the DXD Monetary Policy Framework, the DXD Floor Price Guarantee and the protocol-owned liquidity can be implemented using DXdao’s existing governance tools. 

This proposal commits to implement:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee priced at 70% of the current DXD-NAV Ratio (DXD's circulating market cap to Treasury NAV)
* Provide $250k in DXD/ETH on mainnet once DXD price hits 60% of Treasury NAV, another $250k deposit at 65%, and a $500k deposit when it hits 70% of NAV
* When ready, DXdao governance commits to issuing:
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 85% payout after 6 months will be issued, along with 
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 90% of NAV payout after one year, and
     - $1m in DXD Inverse bonds with 100% NAV payout after two years
* The current DXD token contract should be upgraded and the funds returned to the general treasury

## Definition and clarifications



* Treasury NAV - ultimately defined by governance through guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. This proposal affirms treasury NAV includes all stablecoins, ETH (including staked ETH and other derivatives), Swapr LPs or other liquidity provisioning instruments. It incorporates the value of other treasury assets (like SWPR, ENS, etc) with a pre-defined liquidity discount. The DXD-NAV ratio is the DXD circulating market cap (as defined in the last DXD buyback proposal) divided by the Treasury NAV. This will be calculated at least bi-weekly. The [latest version can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mS1sVmyP0Z3YiA1JiZpHgPHjSIh3da7MawpjQodE34Y/edit#gid=0).
* Inverse bonds - these will be individually launched according to specific parameters (duration, dividend stream, etc). The bonds should payout the % of NAV when they are due, not the NAV when the bond is issued or the DXD deposited. Bonds will need to have a redemption currency of either ETH or Dai/USDC.
* DXD Monetary Policy Committee is meant to involve engaged DXD holders in the formation of policy, but report preparation will need to be completed by DXdao contributors. Details of this will be further provided in the upcoming budget presentations by DXdao governance.
* DXdao may implement other tools to the DXD Monetary Policy Framework in addition to the four listed above. The goal is to incentivize an organic fair market for DXD with minimal open market operations and minimal changes to the underlying liquidity for the treasury.
* Execution of the price floor guarantee will occur on-chain through various trustless models. Previous DXD purchases were in smaller amounts, so executing on a larger scale will require more coordination.

This proposal requests 200k USDC as compensation for the [Exploit Disclosure - DXdao Governance](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625).

Overview: The exploit made use of a mismatch between the smart contract functionality and the front end implementations. By setting a `periods` variable when building a proposal manually, a user was able to set a multiplier on their proposal up to `2**256 - 1` (unit256). Allowing a proposal as innocuous as a rep boost to mint 99% of REP in the DAO, effectively turning the DAO into an EOA - as in being able to pass proposals / do transfers instantly.

Interesting fact, an unsigned integer with 256 bits (unit256), means a maximum value (i.e. multiplier) of 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 could have been set - where even 1 wei of REP minted would have made up over 99% of REP.

During June 2022, after the disclosure above, DXvote reflected periods in the UI. Thereby, making it easier to monitor and reduce risk of such a malicious proposal passing. Furthermore, there are ongoing efforts to add a validation check to the Contributor Scheme so it only accepts new proposals with a single period.

After discussion in the forum, on the weekly dev and governance call, as well as individual conversations with contributors and DXD holders, $200k appears to be an amount with support across the board. A [forum signal vote](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625/16) had 60+% votes over $200k and a [DXD snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hack24.eth/proposal/0x3fe5da3a2e700c13bad5482de17f6c17c59c54f24b023bf09f7811d5953499b3) 80+% in the $100k-$200k range.

Note that DLABS was in no way involved in the coding or auditing of the Contribution Scheme contract. In fact, both of these precede the incorporation of DLABS itself. 

This proposal pays $200k USDC to Decentral Labs LLC (DLABS) at dlabs.eth

QmV4uU6frapxa7Q5rHn4pYpJuLPhdn7CJgtQb2DcT2sihM,Approve New DXD Token Model,"
_Tldr: The DXD Token Working Group proposes a new token model, where “DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.”_

## Background

The DXD Bonding Curve was [launched in May of 2020](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xeb9cf2b3d76664dc1e983137f33b2400ad11966b1d79399d7ca55c25ad6283fa) by DXdao. The bonding curve was an effective fundraising tool but the mint/burn functions of the contract were never able to create a liquid market for DXD. In May 2021, DXdao [launched the DXD Buyback program](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) which purchased DXD off the open market using ETH from the general treasury as well as from the buyback reserve. The program [bought over 15,000 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit#gid=1629643942) (30% of circulating supply), but it was never viewed as a sustainable long-term model for DXD value accrual.

Since the bonding curve launched, DXdao has built and managed several DeFi and governance products, diversified its treasury into $10m+ of stablecoins, and has a team of 20+ full-time contributors focused on building and growing the DXdao ecosystem. The DXD token is at the center of this ecosystem, but there has not been a formal link between the value that DXdao creates and the DXD token. This creates uncertainty for DXD holders, especially as DXD has traded at a significant discount to book value.

In August 2022, DXdao [launched the DXD Token Working Group](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) to draft a long-term model for DXD. The below signal proposal is an output from the Working Group.

The proposal commits DXdao to:



* Introduce four tools in the DXD Monetary Policy Framework that would enable a fair and liquid market for DXD
* Establish a DXD Monetary Policy Committee
* Funding product development and other initiatives that further DXdao’s core mission to enable community freedom 

To further simplify and answer the question, “Why is DXD valuable?”, the WG affirms: **DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.**

## Details

**DXD Monetary Policy Framework**
This proposal establishes four tools to be used by DXdao governance under guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. These are:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee - DXdao commits to buying any amount of DXD on the open market 
* Inverse bonds - smart contracts where DXD can be deposited for a defined period of time in return for a certain % of DXdao treasury assets 
* New DXD minted - allow DXD to be minted in exchange for assets at full NAV
* Protocol-owned liquidity for DXD

**DXD Monetary Policy Committee**
Management of these tools requires close tracking of the DXD market as well as DXdao’s treasury. The committee should be at least three individuals and also include full-time contributors. This work should be compensated in vested DXD. The committee is tasked with:



* Providing quarterly reports on general general direction and outlook of DXD
* Issue monthly recommendations on inverse bond issuance and protocol-owned liquidity
* Work with DXdao governance and treasury on managing redemptions

**Product development funding**
DXdao’s mission is to enable community freedom. It was launched in 2019 as a radical experiment in decentralization. The DXD fundraiser was intended to raise funds for product development in line with this vision. The new token model represents a new social contract between REP & DXD holders. The DXD Token WG affirms DXdao’s commitment to building and funding decentralized products that enable community freedom by committing at least 6% of DXdao’s treasury to fund DXdao’s product & operations for a year.

This % can be changed at any time by governance and represents an overall budget suggestion for DXdao and is not a mandate to spend that amount, nor a maximum amount . This incentivizes the community to grow the size of the treasury.

## Implementation

This signal proposal is the output of the DXD Token Working Group, and if passed by REP & DXD holders, should be implemented by DXdao. Some of the elements will require significant development work before they can be put into practice. In the DXD Monetary Policy Framework, the DXD Floor Price Guarantee and the protocol-owned liquidity can be implemented using DXdao’s existing governance tools. 

This proposal commits to implement:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee priced at 70% of the current DXD-NAV Ratio (DXD's circulating market cap to Treasury NAV)
* Provide $250k in DXD/ETH on mainnet once DXD price hits 60% of Treasury NAV, another $250k deposit at 65%, and a $500k deposit when it hits 70% of NAV
* When ready, DXdao governance commits to issuing:
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 85% payout after 6 months will be issued, along with 
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 90% of NAV payout after one year, and
     - $1m in DXD Inverse bonds with 100% NAV payout after two years
* The current DXD token contract should be upgraded and the funds returned to the general treasury

## Definition and clarifications



* Treasury NAV - ultimately defined by governance through guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. This proposal affirms treasury NAV includes all stablecoins, ETH (including staked ETH and other derivatives), Swapr LPs or other liquidity provisioning instruments. It incorporates the value of other treasury assets (like SWPR, ENS, etc) with a pre-defined liquidity discount. The DXD-NAV ratio is the DXD circulating market cap (as defined in the last DXD buyback proposal) divided by the Treasury NAV. This will be calculated at least bi-weekly. The [latest version can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mS1sVmyP0Z3YiA1JiZpHgPHjSIh3da7MawpjQodE34Y/edit#gid=0).
* Inverse bonds - these will be individually launched according to specific parameters (duration, dividend stream, etc). The bonds should payout the % of NAV when they are due, not the NAV when the bond is issued or the DXD deposited. Bonds will need to have a redemption currency of either ETH or Dai/USDC.
* DXD Monetary Policy Committee is meant to involve engaged DXD holders in the formation of policy, but report preparation will need to be completed by DXdao contributors. Details of this will be further provided in the upcoming budget presentations by DXdao governance.
* DXdao may implement other tools to the DXD Monetary Policy Framework in addition to the four listed above. The goal is to incentivize an organic fair market for DXD with minimal open market operations and minimal changes to the underlying liquidity for the treasury.
* Execution of the price floor guarantee will occur on-chain through various trustless models. Previous DXD purchases were in smaller amounts, so executing on a larger scale will require more coordination.

QmNP4PR2CbhiU4Z4S2KF957dwLe1LUVpNWP6yDPewVzBB5,Approve New DXD Token Model,"_Tldr: The DXD Token Working Group proposes a new token model, where “DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.”_This was discussed on [DAOtalk here](https://daotalk.org/t/proposal-to-upgrade-the-dxd-token-model/4719/12) and submitted to on [mainnet here](https://daotalk.org/t/proposal-to-upgrade-the-dxd-token-model/4719/12), and for a [DXD Snapshot here](https://snapshot.org/#/dxdsnapshot.eth/proposal/0x5dc442df936c24b11703790e28785371159fd1a8b17e1472d895511ba1372822).

## Background

The DXD Bonding Curve was [launched in May of 2020](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xeb9cf2b3d76664dc1e983137f33b2400ad11966b1d79399d7ca55c25ad6283fa) by DXdao. The bonding curve was an effective fundraising tool but the mint/burn functions of the contract were never able to create a liquid market for DXD. In May 2021, DXdao [launched the DXD Buyback program](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) which purchased DXD off the open market using ETH from the general treasury as well as from the buyback reserve. The program [bought over 15,000 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit#gid=1629643942) (30% of circulating supply), but it was never viewed as a sustainable long-term model for DXD value accrual.

Since the bonding curve launched, DXdao has built and managed several DeFi and governance products, diversified its treasury into $10m+ of stablecoins, and has a team of 20+ full-time contributors focused on building and growing the DXdao ecosystem. The DXD token is at the center of this ecosystem, but there has not been a formal link between the value that DXdao creates and the DXD token. This creates uncertainty for DXD holders, especially as DXD has traded at a significant discount to book value.

In August 2022, DXdao [launched the DXD Token Working Group](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) to draft a long-term model for DXD. The below signal proposal is an output from the Working Group.

The proposal commits DXdao to:



* Introduce four tools in the DXD Monetary Policy Framework that would enable a fair and liquid market for DXD
* Establish a DXD Monetary Policy Committee
* Funding product development and other initiatives that further DXdao’s core mission to enable community freedom 

To further simplify and answer the question, “Why is DXD valuable?”, the WG affirms: **DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.**

## Details

**DXD Monetary Policy Framework**
This proposal establishes four tools to be used by DXdao governance under guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. These are:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee - DXdao commits to buying any amount of DXD on the open market 
* Inverse bonds - smart contracts where DXD can be deposited for a defined period of time in return for a certain % of DXdao treasury assets 
* New DXD minted - allow DXD to be minted in exchange for assets at full NAV
* Protocol-owned liquidity for DXD

**DXD Monetary Policy Committee**
Management of these tools requires close tracking of the DXD market as well as DXdao’s treasury. The committee should be at least three individuals and also include full-time contributors. This work should be compensated in vested DXD. The committee is tasked with:



* Providing quarterly reports on general general direction and outlook of DXD
* Issue monthly recommendations on inverse bond issuance and protocol-owned liquidity
* Work with DXdao governance and treasury on managing redemptions

**Product development funding**
DXdao’s mission is to enable community freedom. It was launched in 2019 as a radical experiment in decentralization. The DXD fundraiser was intended to raise funds for product development in line with this vision. The new token model represents a new social contract between REP & DXD holders. The DXD Token WG affirms DXdao’s commitment to building and funding decentralized products that enable community freedom by committing at least 6% of DXdao’s treasury to fund DXdao’s product & operations for a year.

This % can be changed at any time by governance and represents an overall budget suggestion for DXdao and is not a mandate to spend that amount, nor a maximum amount . This incentivizes the community to grow the size of the treasury.

## Implementation

This signal proposal is the output of the DXD Token Working Group, and if passed by REP & DXD holders, should be implemented by DXdao. Some of the elements will require significant development work before they can be put into practice. In the DXD Monetary Policy Framework, the DXD Floor Price Guarantee and the protocol-owned liquidity can be implemented using DXdao’s existing governance tools. 

This proposal commits to implement:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee priced at 70% of the current DXD-NAV Ratio (DXD's circulating market cap to Treasury NAV)
* Provide $250k in DXD/ETH on mainnet once DXD price hits 60% of Treasury NAV, another $250k deposit at 65%, and a $500k deposit when it hits 70% of NAV
* When ready, DXdao governance commits to issuing:
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 85% payout after 6 months will be issued, along with 
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 90% of NAV payout after one year, and
     - $1m in DXD Inverse bonds with 100% NAV payout after two years
* The current DXD token contract should be upgraded and the funds returned to the general treasury

## Definition and clarifications



* Treasury NAV - ultimately defined by governance through guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. This proposal affirms treasury NAV includes all stablecoins, ETH (including staked ETH and other derivatives), Swapr LPs or other liquidity provisioning instruments. It incorporates the value of other treasury assets (like SWPR, ENS, etc) with a pre-defined liquidity discount. The DXD-NAV ratio is the DXD circulating market cap (as defined in the last DXD buyback proposal) divided by the Treasury NAV. This will be calculated at least bi-weekly.
* Inverse bonds - these will be individually launched according to specific parameters (duration, dividend stream, etc). The bonds should payout the % of NAV when they are due, not the NAV when the bond is issued or the DXD deposited. Bonds will need to have a redemption currency of either ETH or Dai/USDC.
* DXD Monetary Policy Committee is meant to involve engaged DXD holders in the formation of policy, but report preparation will need to be completed by DXdao contributors. Details of this will be further provided in the upcoming budget presentations by DXdao governance.
* DXdao may implement other tools to the DXD Monetary Policy Framework in addition to the four listed above. The goal is to incentivize an organic fair market for DXD with minimal open market operations and minimal changes to the underlying liquidity for the treasury.
* Execution of the price floor guarantee will occur on-chain through various trustless models. Previous DXD purchases were in smaller amounts, so executing on a larger scale will require more coordination.

QmNspRDQcwSQFzBNVDYuBYqtUemXZVwBfnohaWwbaYRH5i,​ Melanie Contributor Proposal 10/1/2022-11/30/2022 - END,"This concludes my proposal period from 10/1/2022-11/30/2022  and below is my reflection on the past 2 months of contributing at DXdao 

**What went well:**

October, as most know, was spent in Colombia where I participated in the Infinite Hackathon, Devcon, and our DXretreat. During this time, I assisted with organizing and collaborating with others to plan the events that occurred throughout the weeks we were there. As always, it was amazing to see everyone from DXdao and members of the Ethereum community! A personal highlight of mine was representing DXdao and hosting a workshop at Devcon 6 that focused on the Contributor Experience, Building the Builders: How You Can Create the Next Generation of Web3 Contributors through Education, Peer Review, and Professional Development. It was great to discuss the Contributor Experience with those others interested in the space.

As outlined in my proposal, I began to shift attention this period toward recruiting. @AugustoL and I worked together to develop a process that would help us streamline the recruitment of Senior Solidity developers to DXdao. At the moment, we are recruiting a Senior Solidity developer for DXdao. Thus far, we have sourced and interviewed quite a few applicants. We are narrowing down our selection, and I feel confident we will onboard a contributor who can fill this role in the upcoming weeks.

During this period, I also collaborated with @ross and @whatt4 on testing for Guilds, and we successfully sent all of the Infinite prizes from the DevOps Guild to our hacker winners. DAVI is pretty awesome!

**What went okay**

In November we faced quite a few challenges with the contributor proposal process. Mainly because Alchemy went offline and contributors who normally used Alchemy to submit their proposals had to transition to solely using DXvote. Unfortunately, due to this I had to dedicate more time than expected to individually supporting contributors through this process on DXvote.

I will be claiming funds in this proposal in addition to my compensation. They are for DAVI testing, the txns can be found below, as well as payments I made for the Inifinte hackathon.

I'm compensating for this by adding extra 2 weeks until 20/11/2022.*

# A Retrospective

This proposal period has been quite productive, with DAVI launching in open beta, DXdao contracts v1.5 being audited and a lot of planning going into preparing the frontend for Gov 1.5. 

We were able to quickly iterate over DAVI and push it through the closed beta and open beta, to prepare Guilds to go to production. Meanwhile we received the audit report for Governance 1.5 contracts. The identified issues have now been fixed and the changes are being reaudited.

In this period I took a lot of time to work on a foundation for the DXgov subgraph implementations. The team is now actively developing a subgraph implementation for Guilds, with the intention of integrating this with  DAVI. I'm also working on an effort to unify all DXgov code repositories into a single monorepo, which will reduce our development time and increase productivity.

Due to Devcon, the team was not available for a few weeks for development. Personally in this period I was also moving to Sweden and was not working. This has been reflected in the proposal as an extension of my contribution period.

**Did well**
- Supporting DAVI development efforts and collaborating with the team on brainstorming, planning and mobbing sessions.
- Supporting DAVI deployment and DXdao contracts 1.5 audit fixes.
- Initiating and structuring the DXgov subgraph and monorepo development efforts, hopefully resulting in faster development cycles.
- I believe I've improved on my productivity and availability significantly, and will continue to make sure this is the case.

**Improve on**
- The ongoing struggles around governance and restructuring was taking a toll mentally, so I decided to step back and reduce the time I allocate for governance activities. Going forward I expect to be engaging in governance more.

QmNoR3KsS1PEQ8ghFirmrdRDkAU1hpEKPZgZpfjMgkuW42,DXdao Contributor stipend and Event budget ,"After the Refocus and Restructure proposal passed, DXdao committed to creating stricter event spending parameters and limiting the overall event budget to 150k.

Below outlines a draft proposal for event spending and guidelines for contributor stipends in the upcoming year.

**Overview**

Contributor Stipend + Event budget allocations:

- 100k - Contributor event stipend
   - $4,000 annually per full-time contributor (based on an expected contributor count of ~25 )
- 30k - DXdao offsite
- 20k - DXdao conference or event sponsorships

**100k - Contributor event stipend**

DXdao encourages its contributors to attend conferences throughout the year as they are highly beneficial. Conferences help to promote professional contributor growth, provide an opportunity for product exposure, and allow for networking. Thus, we provide an individual stipend to DXdao contributors who are interested in participating in them. Contributor event stipends will be allocated based on the following criteria:

- % of time contributing to DXdao
  - All contributors are eligible for a stipend. The % commitment to DXdao determines the stipend amount
  - For example, 80% contribution time - $3,200 annually ($1,600 /6 mos)
- All conference stipends must be reviewed and approved ahead of time by the ContributorX
- The event stipend distribution will be handled individually by guilds
- In addition, if a contributor represents DXdao and hosts a talk, panel discussion, or workshop, they are eligible for an additional stipend beyond their annual event stipend. This additional stipend will require prior approval and be claimed through the Services guild. 

**$30k - DXdao offsite**

In line with the DXevents proposal that passed last year, we propose to continue our annual DXretreat in 2023 and request 30k for funding this offsite, (both previous off-site allocations were for 30k.) The ContributorX will be responsible for the coordination and execution of 2023 offsite. If a remaining budget is available, it has also been discussed to explore the idea of having a technical retreat in 2023. See here for further information on the 2021 DXretreat and 2022 DXretreat.

**$20k - Conference or event sponsorships**

We are proposing to allocate 20k towards potential DXdao conference or event sponsorships. The specifics of these sponsorships have not been confirmed yet by DXdao. Further details will be provided in standalone proposals for each sponsorship during the year.

QmP2BRVQt1vPHzrZ32o5fGRriik33z23nF7ueo4en9mfmd,DLABS - Whitehat Reward,"<!-- Yay, no errors, warnings, or alerts! -->

This proposal requests 200k USDC as compensation for the [Exploit Disclosure - DXdao Governance](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625).

Overview: The exploit made use of a mismatch between the smart contract functionality and the front end implementations. By setting a `periods` variable when building a proposal manually, a user was able to set a multiplier on their proposal up to `2**256 - 1` (unit256). Allowing a proposal as innocuous as a rep boost to mint 99% of REP in the DAO, effectively turning the DAO into an EOA - as in being able to pass proposals / do transfers instantly.

Interesting fact, an unsigned integer with 256 bits (unit256), means a maximum value (i.e. multiplier) of 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935 could have been set - where even 1 wei of REP minted would have made up over 99% of REP.

During June 2022, after the disclosure above, DXvote reflected periods in the UI. Thereby, making it easier to monitor and reduce risk of such a malicious proposal passing. Furthermore, there are ongoing efforts to add a validation check to the Contributor Scheme so it only accepts new proposals with a single period.

After discussion in the forum, on the weekly dev and governance call, as well as individual conversations with contributors and DXD holders, $200k appears to be an amount with support across the board. A [forum signal vote](https://daotalk.org/t/exploit-disclosure-dxdao-governance/4625/16) had 60+% votes over $200k and a [DXD snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hack24.eth/proposal/0x3fe5da3a2e700c13bad5482de17f6c17c59c54f24b023bf09f7811d5953499b3) 80+% in the $100k-$200k range.

Note that DLABS was in no way involved in the coding or auditing of the Contribution Scheme contract. In fact, both of these precede the incorporation of DLABS itself. 

This proposal pays $200k USDC to Decentral Labs LLC (DLABS) at dlabs.eth

QmV4uU6frapxa7Q5rHn4pYpJuLPhdn7CJgtQb2DcT2sihM,Approve New DXD Token Model,"
_Tldr: The DXD Token Working Group proposes a new token model, where “DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.”_

## Background

The DXD Bonding Curve was [launched in May of 2020](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xeb9cf2b3d76664dc1e983137f33b2400ad11966b1d79399d7ca55c25ad6283fa) by DXdao. The bonding curve was an effective fundraising tool but the mint/burn functions of the contract were never able to create a liquid market for DXD. In May 2021, DXdao [launched the DXD Buyback program](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) which purchased DXD off the open market using ETH from the general treasury as well as from the buyback reserve. The program [bought over 15,000 DXD](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17C1fcq5JshfG8Zsi_Sv7lmqrrsdT9DKB69XMBkrUp2s/edit#gid=1629643942) (30% of circulating supply), but it was never viewed as a sustainable long-term model for DXD value accrual.

Since the bonding curve launched, DXdao has built and managed several DeFi and governance products, diversified its treasury into $10m+ of stablecoins, and has a team of 20+ full-time contributors focused on building and growing the DXdao ecosystem. The DXD token is at the center of this ecosystem, but there has not been a formal link between the value that DXdao creates and the DXD token. This creates uncertainty for DXD holders, especially as DXD has traded at a significant discount to book value.

In August 2022, DXdao [launched the DXD Token Working Group](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0x40dd1973f7434d192946695919deb58176a192db0c37c8b9316202e006a88ba8) to draft a long-term model for DXD. The below signal proposal is an output from the Working Group.

The proposal commits DXdao to:



* Introduce four tools in the DXD Monetary Policy Framework that would enable a fair and liquid market for DXD
* Establish a DXD Monetary Policy Committee
* Funding product development and other initiatives that further DXdao’s core mission to enable community freedom 

To further simplify and answer the question, “Why is DXD valuable?”, the WG affirms: **DXD gets its value from DXdao’s treasury, which grows from product revenue and its investments into decentralized technologies.**

## Details

**DXD Monetary Policy Framework**
This proposal establishes four tools to be used by DXdao governance under guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. These are:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee - DXdao commits to buying any amount of DXD on the open market 
* Inverse bonds - smart contracts where DXD can be deposited for a defined period of time in return for a certain % of DXdao treasury assets 
* New DXD minted - allow DXD to be minted in exchange for assets at full NAV
* Protocol-owned liquidity for DXD

**DXD Monetary Policy Committee**
Management of these tools requires close tracking of the DXD market as well as DXdao’s treasury. The committee should be at least three individuals and also include full-time contributors. This work should be compensated in vested DXD. The committee is tasked with:



* Providing quarterly reports on general general direction and outlook of DXD
* Issue monthly recommendations on inverse bond issuance and protocol-owned liquidity
* Work with DXdao governance and treasury on managing redemptions

**Product development funding**
DXdao’s mission is to enable community freedom. It was launched in 2019 as a radical experiment in decentralization. The DXD fundraiser was intended to raise funds for product development in line with this vision. The new token model represents a new social contract between REP & DXD holders. The DXD Token WG affirms DXdao’s commitment to building and funding decentralized products that enable community freedom by committing at least 6% of DXdao’s treasury to fund DXdao’s product & operations for a year.

This % can be changed at any time by governance and represents an overall budget suggestion for DXdao and is not a mandate to spend that amount, nor a maximum amount . This incentivizes the community to grow the size of the treasury.

## Implementation

This signal proposal is the output of the DXD Token Working Group, and if passed by REP & DXD holders, should be implemented by DXdao. Some of the elements will require significant development work before they can be put into practice. In the DXD Monetary Policy Framework, the DXD Floor Price Guarantee and the protocol-owned liquidity can be implemented using DXdao’s existing governance tools. 

This proposal commits to implement:



* DXD Floor Price Guarantee priced at 70% of the current DXD-NAV Ratio (DXD's circulating market cap to Treasury NAV)
* Provide $250k in DXD/ETH on mainnet once DXD price hits 60% of Treasury NAV, another $250k deposit at 65%, and a $500k deposit when it hits 70% of NAV
* When ready, DXdao governance commits to issuing:
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 85% payout after 6 months will be issued, along with 
    * $500k in DXD inverse bonds with 90% of NAV payout after one year, and
     - $1m in DXD Inverse bonds with 100% NAV payout after two years
* The current DXD token contract should be upgraded and the funds returned to the general treasury

## Definition and clarifications



* Treasury NAV - ultimately defined by governance through guidance from the DXD Monetary Policy Committee. This proposal affirms treasury NAV includes all stablecoins, ETH (including staked ETH and other derivatives), Swapr LPs or other liquidity provisioning instruments. It incorporates the value of other treasury assets (like SWPR, ENS, etc) with a pre-defined liquidity discount. The DXD-NAV ratio is the DXD circulating market cap (as defined in the last DXD buyback proposal) divided by the Treasury NAV. This will be calculated at least bi-weekly. The [latest version can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mS1sVmyP0Z3YiA1JiZpHgPHjSIh3da7MawpjQodE34Y/edit#gid=0).
* Inverse bonds - these will be individually launched according to specific parameters (duration, dividend stream, etc). The bonds should payout the % of NAV when they are due, not the NAV when the bond is issued or the DXD deposited. Bonds will need to have a redemption currency of either ETH or Dai/USDC.
* DXD Monetary Policy Committee is meant to involve engaged DXD holders in the formation of policy, but report preparation will need to be completed by DXdao contributors. Details of this will be further provided in the upcoming budget presentations by DXdao governance.
* DXdao may implement other tools to the DXD Monetary Policy Framework in addition to the four listed above. The goal is to incentivize an organic fair market for DXD with minimal open market operations and minimal changes to the underlying liquidity for the treasury.
* Execution of the price floor guarantee will occur on-chain through various trustless models. Previous DXD purchases were in smaller amounts, so executing on a larger scale will require more coordination.

It is claiming 3,653 REP for November from this proposal, as well as [3,653 REP earned in October](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0x97acf5a48c52ada055db848361d5e35bade2495aca32bd6db17cb7a1e5a10437) and [3,631 REP earned in September](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/xdai/proposal/0xf76d5dd827bda05f8a299b66b6f92bd0289297af19ff8d88fb62519df1d75b59). In total, 10,937 REP to be minted, in addition to the $8,100 USDC payment.

What I did well:



* Leading the DXD Token Working Group. The [proposal to approve the new model was submitted last week](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xb7ff31ec2bcdb8a254b8a1b06c6d2080a4089135b03ed55e684fd41b5176d946), and if passed, would represent a major shift in how DXdao operates. I led the weekly calls and crafted the proposal itself. This took governance attention and resources but I think a worthwhile investment to find a resolution. I’m hopeful this new model will create a better incentive structure for DXdao expenses and engage new DXD holders.
* Phase 2 restructuring and Phase 3 implementation. In Bogota, I presented three new pillars of DXdao governance - Six month budgetary cycles, priorities board and guild councils. Ultimately, these were all approved in the Phase 2 proposal. So far, I created the [v1 budgetary process](https://daotalk.org/t/phase-3-dxdao-budgetary-process-v1/4711/2) and submitted an [Operations Guild Budget for review](https://daotalk.org/t/operations-guild-h1-2023-budget-proposal-draft/4735/2). 
* ENS DAO delegation - this period was the first full worker proposal with Caney Fork’s ENS delegation. I got the chance to meet many of the ENS DAO community in person in Bogota along with a couple other DXdao contributors. In addition to posting two [This Month](https://daotalk.org/t/this-month-in-ens-dao-september-2022/4592) in [ENS DAO](https://daotalk.org/t/this-month-in-ens-dao/4713), I was also an active follower of the ENS Endaoment vote ([ultimately voting for Karpatkey](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/social-ep2-2-5-selection-of-an-ens-endowment-fund-manager/15188/56)) and [voted](https://ensgrants.xyz/rounds/12) in [ENS small grants](https://ensgrants.xyz/rounds/11)
* Bogota! It was a great experience. I posted [my reflections here](https://daotalk.org/t/reflections-from-colombia/4628).

What I did okay on



* DXD buyback execution. This went okay because we did not do that [many USD purchases of DXD](https://daotalk.org/t/using-stablecoins-for-dxd-buybacks-instead-of-eth/4695). Attention has shifted towards the price floor implementation in the new DXD token model
* Expenses! - I provided an [extensive update on DXdao expenses](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-expenses-update-november-2022/4721) a few weeks ago. This is now in a familiar format but still lags a few months behind because of late proposals. This data gathering will change in the shift to guild budgets. I hope to make these updates quarterly.

What i did not do well on



* Treasury deployment strategies did not materialize. Progress has been made with Mimic but it’s been slow to do more on the treasury front. This will exacerbate further as more of Dave’s time goes to Treasury.
* SWPR governance - we have been unable to find consensus on a strategy forward for SWPR emissions. I submitted a snapshot but [the winning option was None of the above](https://daotalk.org/t/the-future-of-swpr-emissions/4572/14). I don’t think we’ve had the governance bandwidth to grow Swapr governance.
* Swapr - I put in this proposal that I would write a post on Swapr & DAOs. I did not get to that. I have contributed to the Swapr conversation but have not been able to provide value on a new direction.
* Vibes in the DAO - the bear market (and perhaps actual winter in the Northern hemisphere) is taking its toll on contributors and the DXdao community. Many are burnt out after two years of exhaustive work while the DAO shifts in a new direction. To all I would say: this too shall pass. It’s okay to feel frustrated and disappointed. Bear markets are tough! But by definition they do not last forever. Instead of doom and gloom, we should embrace the contraction and the slow pace of the market. Fewer distractions means deeper focus and allowing for independent research or more time-intensive activities.

In total, 10,937 REP to be minted, in addition to the $8,100 USDC payment.

What I did well:



* Leading the DXD Token Working Group. The [proposal to approve the new model was submitted last week](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xb7ff31ec2bcdb8a254b8a1b06c6d2080a4089135b03ed55e684fd41b5176d946), and if passed, would represent a major shift in how DXdao operates. I led the weekly calls and crafted the proposal itself. This took governance attention and resources but I think a worthwhile investment to find a resolution. I’m hopeful this new model will create a better incentive structure for DXdao expenses and engage new DXD holders.
* Phase 2 restructuring and Phase 3 implementation. In Bogota, I presented three new pillars of DXdao governance - Six month budgetary cycles, priorities board and guild councils. Ultimately, these were all approved in the Phase 2 proposal. So far, I created the [v1 budgetary process](https://daotalk.org/t/phase-3-dxdao-budgetary-process-v1/4711/2) and submitted an [Operations Guild Budget for review](https://daotalk.org/t/operations-guild-h1-2023-budget-proposal-draft/4735/2). 
* ENS DAO delegation - this period was the first full worker proposal with Caney Fork’s ENS delegation. I got the chance to meet many of the ENS DAO community in person in Bogota along with a couple other DXdao contributors. In addition to posting two [This Month](https://daotalk.org/t/this-month-in-ens-dao-september-2022/4592) in [ENS DAO](https://daotalk.org/t/this-month-in-ens-dao/4713), I was also an active follower of the ENS Endaoment vote ([ultimately voting for Karpatkey](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/social-ep2-2-5-selection-of-an-ens-endowment-fund-manager/15188/56)) and [voted](https://ensgrants.xyz/rounds/12) in [ENS small grants](https://ensgrants.xyz/rounds/11)
* Bogota! It was a great experience. I posted [my reflections here](https://daotalk.org/t/reflections-from-colombia/4628).

What I did okay on



* DXD buyback execution. This went okay because we did not do that [many USD purchases of DXD](https://daotalk.org/t/using-stablecoins-for-dxd-buybacks-instead-of-eth/4695). Attention has shifted towards the price floor implementation in the new DXD token model
* Expenses! - I provided an [extensive update on DXdao expenses](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-expenses-update-november-2022/4721) a few weeks ago. This is now in a familiar format but still lags a few months behind because of late proposals. This data gathering will change in the shift to guild budgets. I hope to make these updates quarterly.

What i did not do well on



* Treasury deployment strategies did not materialize. Progress has been made with Mimic but it’s been slow to do more on the treasury front. This will exacerbate further as more of Dave’s time goes to Treasury.
* SWPR governance - we have been unable to find consensus on a strategy forward for SWPR emissions. I submitted a snapshot but [the winning option was None of the above](https://daotalk.org/t/the-future-of-swpr-emissions/4572/14). I don’t think we’ve had the governance bandwidth to grow Swapr governance.
* Swapr - I put in this proposal that I would write a post on Swapr & DAOs. I did not get to that. I have contributed to the Swapr conversation but have not been able to provide value on a new direction.
* Vibes in the DAO - the bear market (and perhaps actual winter in the Northern hemisphere) is taking its toll on contributors and the DXdao community. Many are burnt out after two years of exhaustive work while the DAO shifts in a new direction. To all I would say: this too shall pass. It’s okay to feel frustrated and disappointed. Bear markets are tough! But by definition they do not last forever. Instead of doom and gloom, we should embrace the contraction and the slow pace of the market. Fewer distractions means deeper focus and allowing for independent research or more time-intensive activities.

November compensation (90% at Level 8)



* $8,100 in USDC/Dai 
* $8,550 in DXD, using 30 day average for DXD price or minimum $523, vested for 3 years with one year cliff 
* 0.1667% REP (3,653 REP)"

In total, 10,937 REP to be minted, in addition to the $8,100 USDC payment.

What I did well:



* Leading the DXD Token Working Group. The [proposal to approve the new model was submitted last week](https://dxvote.eth.limo/#/mainnet/proposal/0xb7ff31ec2bcdb8a254b8a1b06c6d2080a4089135b03ed55e684fd41b5176d946), and if passed, would represent a major shift in how DXdao operates. I led the weekly calls and crafted the proposal itself. This took governance attention and resources but I think a worthwhile investment to find a resolution. I’m hopeful this new model will create a better incentive structure for DXdao expenses and engage new DXD holders.
* Phase 2 restructuring and Phase 3 implementation. In Bogota, I presented three new pillars of DXdao governance - Six month budgetary cycles, priorities board and guild councils. Ultimately, these were all approved in the Phase 2 proposal. So far, I created the [v1 budgetary process](https://daotalk.org/t/phase-3-dxdao-budgetary-process-v1/4711/2) and submitted an [Operations Guild Budget for review](https://daotalk.org/t/operations-guild-h1-2023-budget-proposal-draft/4735/2). 
* ENS DAO delegation - this period was the first full worker proposal with Caney Fork’s ENS delegation. I got the chance to meet many of the ENS DAO community in person in Bogota along with a couple other DXdao contributors. In addition to posting two [This Month](https://daotalk.org/t/this-month-in-ens-dao-september-2022/4592) in [ENS DAO](https://daotalk.org/t/this-month-in-ens-dao/4713), I was also an active follower of the ENS Endaoment vote ([ultimately voting for Karpatkey](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/social-ep2-2-5-selection-of-an-ens-endowment-fund-manager/15188/56)) and [voted](https://ensgrants.xyz/rounds/12) in [ENS small grants](https://ensgrants.xyz/rounds/11)
* Bogota! It was a great experience. I posted [my reflections here](https://daotalk.org/t/reflections-from-colombia/4628).

What I did okay on



* DXD buyback execution. This went okay because we did not do that [many USD purchases of DXD](https://daotalk.org/t/using-stablecoins-for-dxd-buybacks-instead-of-eth/4695). Attention has shifted towards the price floor implementation in the new DXD token model
* Expenses! - I provided an [extensive update on DXdao expenses](https://daotalk.org/t/dxdao-expenses-update-november-2022/4721) a few weeks ago. This is now in a familiar format but still lags a few months behind because of late proposals. This data gathering will change in the shift to guild budgets. I hope to make these updates quarterly.

What i did not do well on



* Treasury deployment strategies did not materialize. Progress has been made with Mimic but it’s been slow to do more on the treasury front. This will exacerbate further as more of Dave’s time goes to Treasury.
* SWPR governance - we have been unable to find consensus on a strategy forward for SWPR emissions. I submitted a snapshot but [the winning option was None of the above](https://daotalk.org/t/the-future-of-swpr-emissions/4572/14). I don’t think we’ve had the governance bandwidth to grow Swapr governance.
* Swapr - I put in this proposal that I would write a post on Swapr & DAOs. I did not get to that. I have contributed to the Swapr conversation but have not been able to provide value on a new direction.
* Vibes in the DAO - the bear market (and perhaps actual winter in the Northern hemisphere) is taking its toll on contributors and the DXdao community. Many are burnt out after two years of exhaustive work while the DAO shifts in a new direction. To all I would say: this too shall pass. It’s okay to feel frustrated and disappointed. Bear markets are tough! But by definition they do not last forever. Instead of doom and gloom, we should embrace the contraction and the slow pace of the market. Fewer distractions means deeper focus and allowing for independent research or more time-intensive activities.

November compensation (90% at Level 8)



* $8,100 in USDC/Dai 
* $8,550 in DXD, using 30 day average for DXD price or minimum $523, vested for 3 years with one year cliff 
* 0.1667% REP (3,653 REP)"

DXdao general

- After Alchemy went down, I created a [new interface to create ENS proposals](https://ens-proposal-app.vercel.app/) since DXvote does not support the scheme. [Source on GitHub](https://github.com/dxdao/ens-proposal-app).
- We upgraded the DXD token on ETHPOW with @dlabs. But we couldn’t withdraw the funds.
- Continued running the GPv1 until October.
